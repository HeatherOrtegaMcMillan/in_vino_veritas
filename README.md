### Predicting wine ratings based on their chemical properties

## Project Overview

## Goals
The goal with this project is to create a machine learning model to predict the quality of a wine based on it's physicochemical properties. Also it will be to determine key drivers in the wine quality. This Dataset was acquired through UCI's Machine Learning Repository and can be found here

The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.
For more details, consult: http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/ or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009].
Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output)variables 
are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).
